# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Template note.** This is a project-agnostic starter. Replace the `<...>` placeholders
> and the example sections below with the real values for your project. Anything inside
> a `<...>` is a marker that must be filled in or removed before the file is considered
> complete.

## Build & Run Commands

All commands assume a pure-Go build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` (recommended default). Adjust
if your project legitimately needs CGO.

```bash
make build    # Builds binaries to ./build/
make run      # Runs the application (migrations + service start, if applicable)
make test     # go fmt + go vet + go test -race ./...
make lint     # go vet + checks for forbidden imports
make format   # go fmt ./...
make clean    # Removes binaries + go mod tidy
```

Targeted test runs:
```bash
# Single top-level test
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -race -run TestFunctionName ./<package>/

# Single subtest
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -race -run 'TestFunctionName/subtest_name' ./<package>/

# Verbose output (see every subtest pass/fail)
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -race -v ./<package>/

# Benchmarks
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$ ./<package>/

# Coverage
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -race -coverprofile=cover.out ./... && go tool cover -html=cover.out
```

## Architecture Overview

<One-paragraph description of what this service does and its main flow.>

### Layer Responsibilities

Replace the rows below with the real layout of your project. The example below uses a
common layered Go layout — keep, edit, or remove rows as needed.

| Layer | Location | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Entry point | `cmd/<binary>/` | Composition root, server bootstrap |
| Application | `internal/application/service/` | Business logic orchestration |
| Domain | `internal/domain/` | Value objects / models, no logic |
| Gateway | `internal/gateway/` | Routers, controllers, middleware |
| Repository | `internal/repository/` | Persistence queries |
| Infrastructure | `internal/infrastructure/` | External clients (DB, third-party APIs) |
| Tools | `internal/tools/` | Cross-cutting utilities |

### Key Patterns

- **Repository pattern** — each repository type owns its own SQL, migration, and query helper functions. Queries execute inside explicit transactions (`r.db.Transaction(ctx)`). Repositories are passed as interfaces into service and handler layers.
- **Configuration injection** — `SQLITEDB_DSN` and `TELEGRAMBOT_DSN` are read via `dsninjector.Unmarshal(envName)` at startup in `cmd/web/main.go` and live in the systemd `EnvironmentFile`. The public HTTPS origin is passed via the `--api-dsn` CLI flag (format: `https://<host>/`, parsed by `dsninjector.Parse`) and is hardcoded in the systemd unit's `ExecStart` line — never in `.env`. All three configs must be present at startup; the binary calls `log.Fatalf` on any missing value.
- **Embedded assets** — `cmd/web/main.go` embeds the `static/` directory via `//go:embed static`. All static files served by `http.FileServer` live under `cmd/web/static/`.
- **Auth: Telegram WebApp initData HMAC** — the `/api/me/...` endpoint family authenticates callers by verifying the Telegram WebApp `initData` HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signing algorithm uses `secret_key = HMAC_SHA256("WebAppData", botToken)` (the string literal is the key; the token is the message). Implementation lives in `internal/tools/tgwebapp/initdata.go`. The handler injects the validator as a function field so tests can substitute a fake without real bot tokens. No other endpoint requires this auth.

### HTTP Routes

- `GET /api/sources` — list all configured rate sources with latest execution status
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/rates` — most recent rate values for a named source
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/rates/chart` — aggregated chart data (period=week|month|year)
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/history` — execution history for a named source
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/events/failed` — paginated failed events for a source
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/subscriptions` — grouped subscription statistics for a source
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/subscriptions/list` — paginated subscription details for a source
- `GET /api/sources/{name}/events/daily` — daily aggregated event counts for a source
- `PATCH /api/sources/{name}/active` — enable or disable a named source
- `GET /api/stats` — global statistics (source counts, error count)
- `GET /api/errors/execution` — paginated failed execution history records
- `GET /api/events/pending` — all currently pending notification events
- `GET /api/notifications` — last N notification pool records
- `GET /api/notifications/failed` — all failed notification pool records
- `GET /api/me/subscriptions` — caller's own subscriptions enriched with latest rate values; authenticated via Telegram WebApp initData HMAC (`X-Telegram-Init-Data` header or `?initData=` query string fallback)
- `GET /app/subscriptions.html` — Telegram Mini App HTML page (served by embedded static file server; no dedicated route needed)

> Rule (re-)generation is no longer an HTTP endpoint. Use `cmd/rulegen <source>` or
> `cmd/rulegen --all` (intended for operator-managed cron). See `cmd/rulegen/main.go`
> godoc for usage and exit codes.

### Database

Engine: SQLite, accessed via the pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite` driver (no CGO).

Schema lives at the project root: `./migrations/*.sql`. The sibling Go file
`./migrations/embed.go` (`package migrations`) exposes those files as
`var MigrationsFS embed.FS` so they can be consumed without disk I/O at runtime.

`cmd/migrator` is the **only** thing that mutates schema. It embeds
`migrations.MigrationsFS` at build time, opens the DB via `SQLITEDB_DSN`, and
calls `sqlitedb.Migrator.Run(ctx)`. Idempotent: applied filenames are tracked in
`__schema_migrations`.

Service binaries (`cmd/web`, `cmd/collector`, `cmd/notifier`) DO NOT migrate on
startup. They call `sqlitedb.RequireMigratedSchema(ctx, db)` immediately after
opening the DB; a missing or empty `__schema_migrations` table causes
`log.Fatalf("schema not initialised: run cmd/migrator before starting the service")`.

Filename convention: `<YYYYMM>.<NNN>.<table>.<description>.sql` (e.g.
`202605.001.rate_sources.table_initiate.sql`). The `<NNN>` segment is a
**global** zero-padded counter across all tables — it encodes the apply order
explicitly, so a new migration always lands after every earlier one regardless
of which table it touches. Files are applied in lexicographic order. Once
applied to any production database the filename is **immutable** — renaming
triggers a duplicate apply.

| Migration | Table |
|-----------|-------|
| `202605.001.rate_sources.table_initiate.sql` | `rate_sources` |
| `202605.002.rate_values.table_initiate.sql` | `rate_values` |
| `202605.003.rate_user_subscriptions.table_initiate.sql` | `rate_user_subscriptions` |
| `202605.004.rate_user_events.table_initiate.sql` | `rate_user_events` |
| `202605.005.rate_user_events.add_source_name.sql` | `rate_user_events` (alter) |
| `202605.006.execution_history.table_initiate.sql` | `execution_history` |
| `202605.007.rate_sources.seed_initial.sql` | `rate_sources` (seed) |
| `202605.008.rate_user_subscriptions.seed_admin_user.sql` | `rate_user_subscriptions` (seed) |
| `202605.009.rate_sources.add_rule_metadata.sql` | `rate_sources` (alter) |
| `202605.010.rate_sources.add_fetcher_kind.sql` | `rate_sources` (alter) |
| `202605.011.rate_sources.rename_headless_to_chromedp.sql` | `rate_sources` (data) |

Repository files in `internal/repository/` reference table and column names
exclusively through `const` declarations (e.g. `rateSourceTableName`,
`rateSourceNameFieldName`) so a schema rename surfaces at compile time and via
`grep`, never via a runtime "no such column" error.

Deploy flow:
```
make build         # builds all binaries including ./build/migrator
make migrate       # applies any pending .sql files (no-op if up to date)
make run           # starts collector, notifier, web
```

Deployment ordering: the CI workflows in `.github/workflows/{stage,prime}.yml`
run `cmd/migrator` over SSH against the target host (with the service's
`EnvironmentFile` sourced) before swapping the service binary and restarting
the unit. The service systemd units in `configs/` and `deploy/` do **not**
invoke the migrator via `ExecStartPre` — schema reconciliation is a deploy-time
step, not a startup-time step.

### Environment Variables

- `SQLITEDB_DSN` — SQLite connection string, parsed via `dsninjector.Unmarshal`. Format: `sqlite://<path-to-db-file>`
- `TELEGRAMBOT_DSN` — Telegram bot credentials parsed via `dsninjector.Unmarshal`. Format: `<adminChatID>:<botToken>@<host>` where `Addr()` returns the token and `Login()` returns the admin chat ID.

> The public HTTPS origin of the `cmd/web` server is **not** an env var — see the `--api-dsn` CLI flag on the `cmd/web` binary, baked into the systemd unit's `ExecStart` line.

> Never read or edit `.env` files.

### Key Dependencies

List third-party libraries the project depends on and the Go version. Example shape:

- `<module path>` — purpose
- ...
- Go version: `<x.y.z>`

### Frontend (if any)

Describe any embedded or served frontend assets and their location.

### Deployment

Describe how the service is deployed (systemd unit, Docker, k8s, etc.).

## Error Handling

Define the project's error-handling contract here. The example below describes a
common pattern of separating user-facing errors from internal failures — keep, adapt,
or replace it.

### `PublicError` — user-facing errors (example pattern)

A dedicated error type (commonly `internal.PublicError` or similar) is the mechanism for
surfacing safe, human-readable messages to end users. Any error message that is **safe
to show** to a user is wrapped with `internal.NewPublicError(...)` at the point where
the error is created (typically in the service layer).

**Rule**: if a function can fail in a way that meaningfully communicates something to
the user, return a public error. For all other failures (DB down, unexpected nil, etc.)
return a plain error — the controller will send a generic fallback.

#### Creating a public error (service layer)

```go
import "<module>/internal"

// User should know about this
return internal.NewPublicError("Invalid input. <specific guidance>")

// Internal failure — user gets generic message
return fmt.Errorf("db query failed: %w", err)
```

#### Error handling in the controller

The controller catches all errors from sub-handlers and sends the appropriate message.

```go
const errFallbackMessage = "Something went wrong. Try again later."
```

| Situation | What service returns | What user sees |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Expected business failure (validation, state) | `internal.NewPublicError("...")` | The exact message from `PublicError.Details()` |
| Unexpected / infrastructure failure | plain `error` | The fallback message |
| No error | `nil` | Normal happy-path response |

### Testing the error path

Every controller test that exercises an error branch **must** assert:

1. That a response was actually sent (the user is not left in silence).
2. That the sent text equals `PublicError.Details()` when the error is a `PublicError`.
3. That the sent text equals the fallback constant when the error is a plain error.

## Constraints

Replace this section with the real constraints of your project. The list below is a
reasonable default for a CGO-free Go service — keep what applies, drop what doesn't,
add what's missing.

- **Forbidden imports**: list any modules that must never appear in `go.mod` (e.g.
  CGO-dependent SQLite drivers, code generators the team has rejected). Enforce via
  `make lint`.
- **Testing**: Use `github.com/stretchr/testify`; run tests with `-race`; parallel
  subtests preferred where there's no shared mutable state.
- **One `Test*` per method, scenarios as subtests**: each tested method/function gets
  exactly one top-level test function named after it (e.g. `TestEncode` for `Encode`),
  and every scenario for that method lives as a `t.Run("descriptive name", ...)`
  subtest inside it. Do **not** create separate top-level tests like
  `TestEncode_EmptyInput`, `TestEncode_Unicode`, `TestEncode_Error` — these belong
  as subtests of a single `TestEncode`. Methods on a type follow the same rule with
  the standard `TestType_Method` form (e.g. `TestUser_Validate`).
  ```go
  func TestEncode(t *testing.T) {
      t.Parallel()

      t.Run("empty input returns empty string", func(t *testing.T) {
          t.Parallel()
          // ...
      })

      t.Run("unicode is preserved", func(t *testing.T) {
          t.Parallel()
          // ...
      })

      t.Run("returns error on invalid byte", func(t *testing.T) {
          t.Parallel()
          // ...
      })
  }
  ```
- **No CGO**: `CGO_ENABLED=0` must be set for all build and test commands (unless the
  project intentionally requires CGO).
- **Compile-time interface checks**: Every mock/stub struct in test files must have a
  `var _ interfaceName = &mockStruct{}` assertion at the top of the file.
- **No section-divider comments**: Do not use `// --- section ---` or `// ----` style
  separator comments. Let the code structure speak for itself.
- **No skipped errors**: Never use `_` to discard error return values in production or
  test code. Always capture the error and assert/check it. The only exceptions are
  `fmt.Fprint*` writes to loggers, `Rollback()` calls in error-recovery paths, and
  resource `.Close()` in `t.Cleanup` / `defer`.
- **Godoc on exported identifiers**: Every exported identifier (Type, Func, Method,
  Var, Const) gets a doc comment that starts with the identifier name and ends with
  a period — e.g. `// Encode returns the base64-encoded form of v.` Each package
  has exactly one `// Package <name> ...` declaration; `cmd/*` entry points use
  `// Command <name> ...` instead. Skip the comment entirely if it would only
  restate the signature — no `// Foo is a Foo.` fluff. Document concurrency
  guarantees, which methods return `PublicError` vs plain errors, constructor
  lifecycle contracts ("caller must Close"), and error sentinel conditions.
  Preserve existing WHY-comments verbatim; do not overwrite a substantive comment
  with a generic restatement. Unexported symbols only get comments when intent is
  non-obvious — do not bulk-add comments to private helpers.
- **Build outputs live in `./build/`, scratch in `./tmp/`, logs in `./logs/`**:
  Never run `go build` without `-o ./build/<name>` — bare `go build ./cmd/web`
  drops a `./web` binary in the project root, which is **not** in `.gitignore` and
  would be picked up by `git add .`. The same applies to any throwaway artifacts,
  fixtures, or intermediate files: use `./tmp/` (e.g. `./tmp/probe_*`) rather than
  the repo root. Runtime / cyclic logs go to `./logs/`. Only these three directories
  are gitignored at the root.
- **UI conventions**: Document any project-specific rules about emojis, copy, or
  formatting in user-facing surfaces.

## Planning Workflow

All non-trivial work is tracked as a Markdown plan file before implementation begins.

### Directory layout

```
plans/
├── NNN-task-slug.md     # active / in-progress plans (e.g. 001-fix-auth.md)
├── completed/           # plans for fully shipped tasks (e.g. 260422.0001.fix-auth.md)
└── history/             # archived / cancelled plans
```

### File naming

- **Active plans (`plans/`)** — zero-padded sequential index + kebab-case slug:
  `NNN-description.md` (e.g. `001-fix-unauthorized-middleware.md`, `002-add-rate-limiting.md`).
  Pick the next number by checking the highest existing prefix across `plans/`, `plans/completed/`,
  and `plans/history/`.

- **Completed plans (`plans/completed/`)** — date prefix + zero-padded daily index (4 digits) + slug:
  `YYMMDD.NNNN.description.md` (e.g. `260422.0001.fix-unauthorized-middleware.md`).
  `NNNN` resets to `0001` each day and increments for each additional completion on that day.

- **Archived plans (`plans/history/`)** — keep the original `NNN-` filename from `plans/`.

### Lifecycle

1. **Create** — before touching code, produce a plan file in `plans/` using the `NNN-slug.md`
   naming convention described above.
2. **Implement** — work through the tasks defined in the plan. The plan file stays in
   `plans/` while work is in progress.
3. **Complete** — once every acceptance criterion is met and `make test` passes, rename
   and move the file to `plans/completed/` using the date-based convention:
   ```bash
   mv plans/001-fix-auth.md plans/completed/260422.0001.fix-auth.md
   ```
4. **Archive** — if a plan is abandoned or superseded without being fully implemented or
   if we need to save intermediate data or task execution logs, move it to `plans/history/` instead.

### Plan file format

Every plan file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Task Breakdown

## Overview
## Assumptions
## Tasks
### Task N: <Title>
- Description:
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Pitfalls & edge cases:
- Complexity: Easy / Medium / Hard
## Execution Order
## Risks
## Trade-offs
```

### Rules

- **One plan per concern.** Don't bundle unrelated changes in a single plan file.
- **Plan before code.** Claude must create (or confirm an existing) plan file before
  writing or modifying any source files.
- **Keep plans honest.** If implementation diverges from the plan, update the plan file
  before moving it to `completed/`.
- **Slug matches intent.** The description part of the filename should be readable at a glance:
  `002-add-rate-limiting.md`, `003-migrate-sqlite-to-postgres.md`, not `004-task.md`.

## Agent Pipeline

All non-trivial tasks follow a three-stage pipeline using specialized agents. The review
stage fans out to **five `gocode-reviewer` instances running in parallel**, each
with a distinct lens. A separate `gocode-testdoctor` agent is invoked on-demand
whenever tests fail, at any stage.

```
User describes task
    ↓
1. gocode-architect
    → Creates plan file at plans/NNN-slug.md (see Planning Workflow)
    ↓
2. gocode-engineer
    → Implements the tasks defined in the plan
    ↓
3. gocode-reviewer × 5 (run in parallel — single message, five tool calls)
    Lens A: correctness, races, edge cases, error paths
    Lens B: tests, coverage, flakiness, fixtures
    Lens C: ops, observability, log volume, operator UX
    Lens D: security, input validation, secrets, auth boundaries
    Lens E: performance & architecture — allocations, blocking I/O,
            goroutine/resource leaks, API contracts (breaking changes,
            exported surface stability), interface boundaries, layering
            (dependency direction), future-proofing
    ↓
   Orchestrator synthesises all five reports, deduplicates findings,
   resolves conflicts (e.g. one reviewer flags as Blocker what another
   accepts as a trade-off), and presents the merged punch list to the user.
    ↓
  ❌ Blocker/Major found?  → Back to gocode-engineer with the consolidated findings.
                             After fix, run ONE targeted reviewer pass on the changed
                             lines (not all 5 again) before re-approval.
  ⚠️  Tests failing?        → gocode-testdoctor diagnoses and patches, then rerun the
                             targeted reviewer pass.
  ✅ All five approve?      → Orchestrator moves the plan: mv plans/NNN-slug.md
                             plans/completed/YYMMDD.NNNN.slug.md
```

### Agent responsibilities

| Agent | Owns | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| `gocode-architect` | Planning, decomposition, trade-offs | New plan file in `plans/` |
| `gocode-engineer` | Implementation, tests for new code | Code + tests in the repo |
| `gocode-reviewer` (×5, parallel) | Lens-specific verdicts, severity-ranked findings, patch sketches | Five independent review reports |
| `gocode-testdoctor` | Triage of failing tests, minimal patches | Code/test fixes, re-run of `make test` |

The orchestrating agent (the main Claude session driving the pipeline) owns
synthesis: merging the five reports, resolving conflicting verdicts, deciding
which findings to act on, and moving the plan to `completed/` once everyone
signs off.

### Rules

- **No skipping stages.** Every task starts with the architect and ends with the five-reviewer fan-out.
- **Plan file first.** The architect MUST produce a plan file before any code is written. If a plan already exists for the task, update it rather than creating a new one.
- **Five reviewers, five lenses, one message.** All five `gocode-reviewer` agents are launched in a single tool-call batch (multiple `Agent` blocks in one message) so they run in parallel. Each prompt names the lens explicitly and tells the agent what to SKIP (the other lenses) to avoid duplicated work.
- **No solo reviewer pass on first review.** Even for small changes the full five-lens fan-out is required, because the lenses catch genuinely different classes of issue (Reviewer A won't see test gaps, Reviewer D won't see log-volume problems). Skipping lenses is what the orchestrator does AFTER a Blocker/Major fix, not BEFORE the first verdict.
- **Lens prompts are self-contained.** Each reviewer's prompt must include: (1) the lens name, (2) what to focus on, (3) what to SKIP (so it doesn't restate other lenses), (4) the file list, (5) the deliverable shape (Blocker / Major / Minor / Nit with file:line + patch sketch), (6) the word cap (typically 600 words).
- **Re-review after fixes is single-pass.** Once an engineer addresses Blocker/Major findings, the orchestrator runs ONE reviewer pass scoped to the changed lines, not the full fan-out. Re-running all five each iteration is expensive and rediscovers nothing.
- **Conflict resolution is explicit.** When reviewers disagree (one says Blocker, another says trade-off), the orchestrator chooses, names the rejected suggestion, and explains the reasoning to the user before moving on. The user has final say.
- **Orchestrator gates completion.** The plan moves to `plans/completed/` only after every reviewer's Blocker and Major findings are addressed (either fixed, or explicitly accepted with rationale). The rename uses the standard `YYMMDD.NNNN.slug.md` format.
- **`make test` must pass** before review begins. If it fails, hand the logs to `gocode-testdoctor` first — reviewers should not waste time on a red tree.
- **Testdoctor is scoped.** It patches tests or the minimal production code needed to make the failure go away. It does not redesign or refactor.
